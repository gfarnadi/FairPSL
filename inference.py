 - *r_list* is a list of tuples (weight, body, head)
 - *body* and *head* are lists of tuples (is_constant, value/id, is_negated)
 - *is_constant* is a flag, True if the truth value is known, False otherwise
 - *value/id* equals the truth value if it is known, 
   and is the id of the corresponding variable otherwise
 - *is_negated* is a flag, True if the atom is negated in the rule, 
   False otherwise
